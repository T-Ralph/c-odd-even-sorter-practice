# C# Odd/Even Sorter Practice T-Ralph

## Requirements
- Include a README.md with a link to your (public) Trello
- Your application should include a docstring at the top with a title, purpose, your name and the last modified date
- Your application should include a prompt explaining the purpose of the application and how it should be operated to the user
- Your application should allow a user to input a maximum of 10 numbers to an array
- Your application should continue to ask the user to input numbers until all 10 slots have been filled in the array, or the escape sequence “done” is entered - all unfilled array slots should be ignored
- Given an array of numbers, the application should pull all odd numbers and sort them from lowest to highest, then the application should pull all even numbers and sort them from lowest to highest before outputting the entire array to the user (example - [6, 4, 3, 7, 8] would become [3, 7, 4, 6, 8])
- You must write a method for your sort code, which main() calls on - your application must not have the sorting code in main().
